## Description

This package contains set of tools used to to fetch War Thunder profiles, including:

- Get user profile by ID
- Get user ID by nick
- etc...

All data comes from public API.

**IMPORTANT**: This project is **NOT** affiliated with Gaijin Entertainment in any way, but is built by developers in the War Thunder community who love War Thunder. **If it infringes upon your rights, please contact author**.

Many thanks to [@RaidFourms](https://github.com/RaidFourms) for his immense help which inspired this project.

### Not a python developer?

You can use API server directly by [RaidFourms's wtpt-api](https://github.com/RaidFourms/wtpt-api) project.

### Don't know how to use API server?

Well, this is a tool project and not intended for non-developers ðŸ˜µðŸ˜µðŸ˜µ

## Usage

### Install

You can easily install it with pip:

```bash
pip install wt-profile-tool
```

Or you can install it with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
poetry add wt-profile-tool
```

### Initialize the tool

You can simply import the class and use it like the following

```python
from wt_profile_tool import WTProfileTool

wtpt = WTProfileTool()
```

Or you want to customize the tool, for example, you want to set all request timeout to 30 seconds, you can do it like the following

```python
wtpt = WTProfileTool(request_timeout=httpx.Timeout(30.0))
```

Parhaps you want to use a custom user agent instead of a random one, you can do it like the following

```python
wtpt = WTProfileTool(request_headers={"User-Agent": "YOUR UA HERE"}, random_ua=False,)
```

For more information about the parameters, please refer to the [source code](./wt_profile_tool/main.py).

### Get user ID by nick

After you initialize the tool, you can use `search_userid_by_prefix_nick` function to get user ID by prefix nickname.

```python
# This guy is real exist
user_id_map = wtpt.search_userid_by_prefix_nick("OnTheRocks")
```

**Note**: Every time you call a function it will send a request to a War Thunder server. Make sure your network can access the server and **DO NOT ABUSE IT**.

### Get user profile by ID

After you have the user ID, you can use `get_profile_by_userid` function to get user profile.

```python
# This guy is OnTheRocks
profile = wtpt.get_profile_by_userid("5363987")
```

Then, you can do something with the `profile`.

```
base_info = profile.base_info

nick = base_info.nick
```

`profile` is a `Pydantic V2 BaseModel`, you can use `profile.model_dump_json()` to get the json string if you like.

```python
profile_json = profile.model_dump_json()
```

A JSON string should look like the following:

```json
{
  "base_info": {
    "user_id": "",
    "nick": "OnTheRocks",
    "icon_id": null,
    "title": "Tank Destroyer",
    "clan_id": null,
    "clan_tag": null,
    "clan_type": null,
    "clan_name": null,
    "clan_member_role": null
  },
  "level_info": {
    "level": 100,
    "exp_has": 27169491,
    "exp_left": 27169491,
    "completeness": 4.6071824188000174e18
  },
  "lang": "en",
  "battle_list": []
}
```

**NOTE:** Data seems broken or missmatch? Please open an issue and provide example.

> Maybe you want to know why I use player `OnTheRocks` as an example. Because he was a cheater. I reported him and he was banned. This is the price you pay for using cheats to kill me 5 times in one battle. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

### More functions?

You can refer to the [source code](./wt_profile_tool/main.py) to find more functions.
